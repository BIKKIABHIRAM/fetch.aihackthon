# project title : AI-Enhanced Text Summarization with Fetch.ai Agents.
**Description:**
    The AI-Enhanced Text Summarization project leverages cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) models from Hugging Face and Fetch.ai's advanced agent technology to provide an efficient and automated solution for summarizing large bodies of text. By harnessing the power of state-of-the-art transformer models, this project aims to condense lengthy documents into concise summaries while retaining the most important information. Whether for research, business, or personal use, our solution offers a seamless and intelligent approach to text summarization.


**Instructions to Run the Project:**
    To run the project locally, follow these steps:
    
    Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
               [ git clone <repository-url> ]
               ry and install the required dependencies using pip:
               [ pip install -r requirements.txt ]
    Set Up API Keys and Environment Variables:
    Copy the .env.example file to .env.
    Obtain API keys for Hugging Face and Fetch.ai, and replace the placeholders in the .env file with your actual keys.
    Run the Main Script: Execute the main script to start the text summarization agent:
              [ python main.py ]
              
   Interact with the Agent:
   Follow the prompts provided by the agent to input the text you want summarized.
   
   Alternatively, you can send HTTP requests to the agent's endpoint for text summarization.

**Special Considerations:**

   **Internet Connection:** Ensure a stable internet connection as Hugging Face models may require internet access to download necessary resources.
   
   **Input Text Quality:** Provide well-formatted input text for accurate and meaningful summaries.
   
   **Security:** Protect sensitive data such as API keys by avoiding inclusion in the public repository. Instead, use environment variables to securely store and 
   access these keys.
