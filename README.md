# project title : TEXT SUMMARIZATION WITH AI AGENT.
**Description:**
    This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of text summarization using Hugging Face models integrated with Fetch.ai AI Agent technology. Text summarization is the process of distilling large bodies of text into concise summaries while preserving the most important information. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing models from Hugging Face and Fetch.ai's agent technology, we enable efficient and automated text summarization for various use cases.
**Instructions to Run the Project:**
    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install the necessary dependencies by running:
               [ pip install -r requirements.txt ]
    Set up API keys and environment variables (if required) as specified in the .env.example file.
    Run the main script to start the text summarization agent:
              [ python main.py ]
   Follow the prompts or send HTTP requests to the agent to request text summarization.
**Special Considerations:**
   Ensure that you have a stable internet connection as the Hugging Face models may require internet access to download the necessary resources.
   Provide appropriate input text for summarization requests to obtain meaningful summaries.
